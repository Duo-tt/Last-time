                    <p>The idea for this cover what from a quote from the author Haruki Murakami about writing the book. He wanted to emulate a Jazz song. I thought about this cover is the same vain. More so text heavy cover with varied weight to emphasize nonconformity that is presets I feel in jazz song, but your relief is the placement of "Haruki Murakami" on the cover.</p>

                    <p>I liked the idea of using the phrase "Who watches the WATCHMEN". In a particular section of the comic, a certain someone is watching over. The various expression for the eyes definitely tells it own story.</p>

Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up. Man bursts into tears. Says, But doctor...I am Pagliacci.</q>

                    <p>For this cover, I wanted to invoke the feeling of the 1950s book. While I do believe the book publish in the 50s still has a marvelous cover, the idea was to see if I could create a very organic layout of spots, using watercolor and cold press paper. I still wanted people to connect with the cover if where they might have first heard of the Hundred and one Dalmatians which would be from the Disney animated movie, the font represents that Disney feeling.</p>

                    <p>Agatha Christie always comes back into the limelight every few years it seems, so I wanted to capture that resurgence again but look at her in a different light. Or more so, how this generation would notice her, and her work. As terrible as it may seem I thought movie poster but not just any movie poster, a dare I say superhero style poster. Big, bold lettering, but still reserved; something that would capture your attention and make you wonder over to see more.</p>
