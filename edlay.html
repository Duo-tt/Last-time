                    <p>The idea for this cover what from a quote from the author Haruki Murakami about writing the book. He wanted to emulate a Jazz song. I thought about this cover is the same vain. More so text heavy cover with varied weight to emphasize nonconformity that is presets I feel in jazz song, but your relief is the placement of "Haruki Murakami" on the cover.</p>

                    <p>For this cover, I wanted to invoke the feeling of the 1950's book. While I do believe the book publish in the 50s still has a marvelous cover, the idea was to see if I could create a very organic layout of spots, using watercolor and cold press paper. I still wanted people to connect with the cover if where they might have first heard of the Hundred and one Dalmatians which would be from the Disney animated movie, the font represents that Disney feeling.</p>

                    <p>If you know Lolita, then you know. I wanted to convey the feeling that some, if not most, people experience when coming forward about their SA. They can and at most times chastised about what happened. The cover image and text are small to both represents that feeling. I was also inspired by the 1Q84 cover, where there is an image of a woman being the cover, but the cover itself is just a cutout of the eyes and mouth for the woman behind.</p>
